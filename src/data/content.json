      "Eatcouver was founded in 2015 with a simple mission: support local restaurants by sharing their spaces, food, and stories with Vancouver’s community. What began as a passion project quickly evolved into a powerful marketing channel for hospitality businesses. By staying deeply attuned to platform trends and audience behaviour, our team drove consistent, organic growth and built one of Vancouver’s most trusted food platforms.",
      "Our philosophy is straightforward: tell each restaurant’s story in the way they want it told. Visibility is great, but far less so when messaging doesn’t align with a restaurant’s story and brand. This is why collaboration with our partners is at the core of our operations.",
      "We believe great content is not reserved for only the most prized venues. Family-run gems tucked down back lanes, nostalgic diners, and new neighbourhood spots deserve just as much visibility as any fine dining room. Every restaurant has a story worth sharing. Our role is to tell it with care, intention, and authenticity.",
      "In January 2024, our founder Ben launched @recipeincaption, applying the same principles we used to grow Eatcouver. By 2026, the page surpassed one million followers on Instagram alone and became one of the highest-performing accounts in the recipe space, reinforcing our team’s understanding of how to build reach through strong storytelling.",
      "After Eatcouver surpassed 100,000 local followers in summer 2025, we expanded into full-scale hospitality media and content creation. Today, we partner directly with restaurants to produce native, high-performing content for their own channels, coordinate creator visits, and use our platforms to amplify local visibility. Our approach remains the same: don’t employ a one-size-fits-all approach, adapt quickly, and tell stories that resonate deeply with Vancouver's foodie community.",
